const SAFETY_MATERIALS = [
  `# Error Types
  Slips and lapses
  - Failure to correctly execute a procedure
  - Slip is a failure of execution, lapse is a failure of memory
  - Typically found in skilled behavior
  Mistakes
  - Using wrong procedure for the goal
  - Typically found in rule-based behavior or problem-solving behavior
  `,
  `# Capture errors
  - A frequent sequence of actions captures a less frequent sequence of actions
  - Leave your house and find yourself walking to school instead of where you meant to go
  - vi :w command (to save the file) vs. :wq command (to save and quit)
  - Excel array formulas must be entered with Ctrl-Shift-Enter, not just Enter
  `,
  `# Description errors
  - Actions have similar descriptions
  - Description can be visual, spatial, or semantic
  - Consistency (same) is good for learning
  - Inadvertent similarity (close but not quite) is bad for safety
  `,
  `# Mode errors
  Modes: states in which actions have different meanings
  - Vi's insert mode vs. command mode
  - Caps Lock
  - Drawing Palette
  `,
  `# Causes of Slips
  "Strong-but-wrong" effect
  - Similarity
  - High frequency
  Inattention or inappropriate attention
  Speed / accuracy tradeoff
  `,
  `# Error Prevention
  Safety from Capture Errors
  - Avoid habitual action sequences with identical prefixes
  Safety from Description Errors
  - Avoid actions with very similar descriptions
  - Keep dangerous commands away from common ones
  Safety from Mode Errors
  - Eliminate modes
  - Increase visibility of mode
  - Spring-loaded or temporary modes
  - Disjoint action sets in different modes
  Safety by Forcing User Interaction
  - Interlock: creating mutual dependency in a sequence of actions
  - Lockin: keeping specific operations active to avoid accidental stopping
  - Lockout: asking users to perform some action to proceed with a task
  Confirmation Dialogs
  `,
  `# Writing Error Message Dialogs
  Best error message is none at all
  - Errors should be prevented
  - Be more flexible and tolerant
  - Nonsense entries can often be ignored without harm
  Be Precise and Comprehensible
  - Be precise
  - Restate user's input
  - Speak the user's language 
  Suggest Reasons and Solutions
  - Give constructive help: why the error occurred and how to fix it
  Suggest Reasons and Solutions
  - Be polite and nonblaming
  Avoid Loaded Words
  - Fatal, illegal, aborted, terminated
